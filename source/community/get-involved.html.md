# Get Involved

Help us make the RDO community site a great place for users and cloud operators in the Red Hat ecosystem by sharing your OpenStack questions and solutions on [ask.openstack](http://ask.openstack.org), and by adding [the most useful solutions](/documentation/troubleshooting/) and [stories](/documentation/case-studies/) to the RDO website.

## Discuss and stay informed

Come and chat real-time with RDO users on **IRC** —you can usually find us in the #rdo channel—or hanging out with the wider OpenStack community in the #openstack channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net). Discussion around the RDO Deployment with Packstack and OpenStack Puppet Modules takes place in the #rdo-puppet channel.

Join us for various [Events](/event/events/) around the world. [Organize-a-meetup](/uncategorized/organize-a-meetup/).

If you want to help with our packaging and integration work, consider [joining our contributor **mailing list**](//www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list), and check out [Red Hat's OpenStack pages on github](//github.com/redhat-openstack).

Join our [newsletter mailing list](//www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-newsletter) for monthly updates on RDO and the larger OpenStack world.

## Contribute to OpenStack and Packstack

If you see something which you'd like to improve in RDO, there is a good chance that the best place to make that happen is in [the OpenStack project](http://www.openstack.org).

The Puppet modules used in packstack are on [Github](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/openstack-puppet-modules) and packstack itself is on [Stackforge](https://github.com/stackforge/packstack). There's great information about contributing to Packstack in the [Packstack wiki page in OpenStack's wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Packstack).

To file bugs against RDO itself, use the [RDO bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO).

Participate in the packaging effort by following the [RDO Packaging Documentation](https://openstack.redhat.com/packaging/). Come to our [bi-weekly RDO Packaging Meeting](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Packaging) and the weekly [CentOS Cloud SIG](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud) meeting (15:00 UTC, #centos-devel on Freenode IRC).

Contribute any packaging and integration patches via [our contributor mailing list](//www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list), [fork us on GitHub](//github.com/redhat-openstack), or propose improvements to OpenStack on [the upstream Launchpad page](//launchpad.net/openstack).
